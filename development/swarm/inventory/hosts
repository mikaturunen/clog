# List all development hosts that we want to test against and are created by Vagrantfile. Update accordingly, depending on how
# the vagrant associates the ports for the machines.

# PLEASE NOTE: you will have to use full path to the private_key file for this to work properly, I've removed the full path as it's system specific, replace the '<INSERT_FULL_PATH_HERE>' part with your full path to the repo root.
