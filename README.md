# clog

clog = "*Clog definition, to hinder or obstruct with thick or sticky matter; choke up: to clog a drain*".

Commonly the problem of getting logs from distributed environments is not as trivial as it's made out to be. clog, short for Cloud log, aims to solve this problem by providing a convenient way of deploying a set of technologies for aggregating and collecting logs from multiple environments for multiple different use purposes such as analysis, archiving and alerts.
